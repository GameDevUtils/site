# The Team

At the time of this writing, "the team" has just one member&mdash;me. As the project progresses, I'd love to have people with similar passions for cross-platform [#gamedev](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23gamedev){:target="_blank"} and tools development come aboard. Until then, I'll be using a few of the most talented developers I know to help we with design and technology decisions.

  Joe also [dabbles](https://groundh0g.deviantart.com/){:target="_blank"} in sketching, cartooning, and creating 3D models. When you see his artistic creations, you'll understand why he makes his living as a programmer.

{% endcapture %}

{% capture bioBody %}
  Scott Escue is an expert in enterprise Java development using a mix of web technologies. He's been paying the bills with a keyboard and a compiler for more than 14 years - engaging with new technologies and solving problems both large and small. While most of his experience in the database world has been with Oracle, he also works with a variety of other, smaller, open-source data store options.

  His interests aren't limited to the Java world, though. When away from the day job, Scott uses Ruby and Rails for his personal projects. And, while not quite the expert yet, he has been flexing his iOS and Android application development muscles. You can find an example of Scott's open-source projects at [Dropwizard EntityManager](http://scottescue.com/dropwizard-entitymanager/){:target="_blank"} on GitHub.
